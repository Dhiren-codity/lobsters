I (@pushcx) try to timebox non-urgent Lobsters maintenance to the scheduled office hours streams (https://push.cx/stream), so it may take me a couple days to respond. If you don't want your issue or PR reviewed on a stream, say so and I won't.

If your PR is part of your classwork as a student, please explain what your assignment is. It helps me give you better feedback.
